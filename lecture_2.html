<p>Updates: first quiz is available as of today! It will cover the
readings and will be due Monday night at midnight.</p>
<p>For today, I asked you all to read Johnson (1999) and Dushoff et
al. (2019). What did you all think… was this eye-opening, perhaps?</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A problem perceived by many in our field is that <strong>too many
ecologists and environmental scientists</strong> put <strong>too much
emphasis on p-values</strong>. Not surprisingly, many statistics classes
also focus heavily on how to calculate p-values. When I first learned
statistics in graduate school, we had to calculate the F-statistics and
then look up the associated p-value in the back of a book…</p>
<p>Computers can do this for us now! Which is a great benefit. But yet,
classes still focus on calculating p-values, because professors have
placed historical emphasis on it. It’s a <u>self-repeating process</u>.
My goal with this class is to de-emphasize p-values and avoid repeating
this iterative process. So with this lecture and discussion today, we
will talk about what p-values really area – and practical ways to
approach using them.</p>
</div>
<div id="probability-values-p-values" class="section level2">
<h2>Probability values (p-values)</h2>
<p><strong>p-value – the probability of getting the observed data or
something more extreme, given <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>
(null hypothesis; ‘H-naught’) is assumed true</strong> (Johnson
1999).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the null hypothesis</strong>? No relationship; e.g.,
no difference between groups, no slope in a regression line; no ‘signal’
in your data.</li>
<li>We assume there is some <strong>alternative, hypothesized
relationship</strong>. We then collect data and perform a statistical
test of the null hypothesis: there is no relationship between the X and
Y-variables.</li>
<li>If we get a p-value less than 0.05, this is ‘statistically
significant’. We then reject the null and infer (learn) that this
alternative relationship really does exist in the world.</li>
<li>p = 0.05 is often called the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> level; it is the threshold of
whether a result is significant or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the first thing I want you to know about p-value is that it
says nothing <em>about your data</em> – nothing about the data you have
in hand. It tells us the probability of getting some data ‘like ours’ or
more extreme than ours, given that the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to know the probability of getting our data, we would have
to know the truth about the system – what the true relationship is. We
would have to know if there really is a relationship, or not. But we
don’t know this.</li>
<li>The p-value assumes there is no relationship (no slope, no
difference between groups) and tells us what the probability of getting
the outcome we got, under that assumption of no relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I flipped a coin and it is in my hand. What is
the probability that it is heads? 50%?</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong. It has already been flipped. It either <strong>is</strong>
heads (1), or it <strong>is not</strong> (0). I know the truth.</li>
<li>What is the probability that you guess correct? Now you’ve got a
50:50 chance.</li>
<li>Once it’s been flipped, it either is or it isn’t.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this idea that your data can have some probability, that it’s due
to chance, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true – this
doesn’t make sense. <u>The p-value does not tell us about the
probability of our data</u>.</p>
<p>Similarly, a p-value tells us the probability of observing data (or
something more extreme) assuming the null hypothesis is true – but it
does not tell us the probability that the null hypothesis itself is true
or false.</p>
<p>And finally: the probability of getting your data or more extreme
data depends on the methods, which is impractical to account for in a
statistical model. Johnson didn’t like this either.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-definitions-of-p-values" class="section level2">
<h2>Alternative definitions of p-values</h2>
<p>There are alternative definitions of a p-value that you might come
across.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Probability that your data was due to <em>chance</em></u>.
<ul>
<li>However, this is <strong>wrong</strong>: we know your data was due
to sampling or process error.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><u>Probability that the null hypothesis is true</u>.
<ul>
<li>The idea here is that if the p-value is low, then we might think
there is a small probability that the null is true.</li>
<li>However, in reality, the null is either TRUE or NOT. Just because we
don’t whether the null is true or false does not mean there is some
underlying probability of one reality vs. the other. So this
interpretation is also <strong>wrong</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics can be hard to understand because these strange or
<em>whonky</em> definitions are used. But we use them, and they do work,
if we understand what the limitations are.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons why Johnson (1999) and many, many
other authors don’t like the use of ‘naked p-values’. Too often people
use p-values <strong>inappropriately</strong> or with <strong>a
wrong/incorrect definition</strong>. And then they make conclusions that
they should not be making.</p>
</div>
<div id="p-values-an-expression-of-clarity" class="section level2">
<h2>P-values: an expression of <em>clarity</em></h2>
<p>All the p-value really tells us is <em>how clear the statistical
results are</em> that we are inferring from our data. Large p-values are
unclear results; small p-values are clear results.</p>
<p>I am not going to advocate for using the approach described by
Dushoff, because I don’t think it solves the problem. But I think they
make a good point, that: we want to think about a p-value as
<strong>some indication of your data and how <em>clear</em> the results
of those data are.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the p-value is <strong>large</strong>, the results are
unclear.</li>
<li>If the p-value is small (e.g., less the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> threshold of 0.05), we conclude
there is a clear relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, when the p-value is small, we conclude that there is a
statistically-significant relationship. But the <u>p-value does not
necessarily mean the relationship is <strong>LARGE</strong></u>.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we get a large p-value, it does not mean the
relationship is absent or SMALL.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-null-hypothesis-is-often-not-true" class="section level2">
<h2>The null hypothesis is often not true</h2>
<p>Another problem that Johnson points out with p-values and this
definition is…</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the null hypothesis ever really true to begin
with? What do you think?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it can be!! Trivial example: we might hypothesize that the
color of a human’s shirt when they are planting trees influences plant
growth. Because shirt is unlikely to have a biological effect on, the
null hypothesis (no influence of shirt color on plant growth) is likely
to be true. A controlled experiment will support this.</li>
<li>However, with observational studies, there is rarely zero different
between groups and the null hypothesis is rarely true. Johnson talked
about nonsensical tests that were performed:
<ul>
<li>E.g., coyote diet difference between spring and fall, tree density
between clear cut and non-clear cut forest stands, etc.</li>
<li>These are nonsensical because we know these to be false
beforehand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Often you have an <em>a priori</em> reason to believe there is a
relationship. So, the chance that there is no difference is often
nonsensical. You may have a small effect, but there is often a
relationship.</li>
<li>This is a limitation of p-vales: the null hypothesis is never really
true… and yet we are calculating p-values <u>based on the assumption
that the null is true</u>! This doesn’t make a lot of sense.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="p-values-effect-size-and-sample-size" class="section level2">
<h2>P-values, effect size, and sample size</h2>
<p>Regardless of the statistical test you use, P-values are a function
of two things: <em>‘effect size’</em> and <em>sample size</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>effect size – the slope or difference between
groups</strong>; the larger the effect size, the smaller the
p-value</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the term ‘effect size’ loosely in this class:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Just because you demonstrate a correlation, it does not mean
there is ‘causation’. Just because we observe a relationship between two
variables in an observational study does not mean cause and
effect.</p></li>
<li><p>The only way to demonstrate causation is to use a
<strong>manipulative experiment</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>We may make assumptions about causation when looking at the
effect of variable X on Y, but we never actually claim there is
causation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sample size – the number of observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>n</em> increases, p decreases</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>n</em> decreases, p increases</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>P-values are arbitrarily influenced by effect size and sample size,
<u>which can have consequences on how we interpret our results</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to have large sample sizes and get a significant
p-value with a very, very small effect size.</li>
<li>For this reason, we have to report how big the effect sizes are, and
then interpret whether the effect sizes are biologically significant or
not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best not to confuse <em>statistical significance</em> with
<em>biological significance</em>.</p>
<p>And I have a good example of this.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-vs.-biological-significance"
class="section level2">
<h2>Statistical vs. biological significance</h2>
<p>Example: a drug to reduce the risk of heart attack. This drug is
being used by the public and as such, it had to pass clinical trials.
Researchers sampled the population of heart attack survivors and gave
them either this new drug or a placebo drug. The patients were monitored
for five years and the researchers used a statistical analysis to test
whether the drug reduced risk of having a second heart attack.</p>

<p>If we do the math and run a chi-squared contingency table analysis…
the chi-squared is 42.2 with 1 degree of freedom; look up the p-value
for that, and it is 9.02x10-11.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does this drug work??</p>
<p>Yes! It has a statistically significant effect of reducing heart
attack. The results are pretty clear.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is this a drug you would take??</p>
<p>I dunno. I would next ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much does it cost?</li>
<li>How do results compare to walking a mile every day, eating healthy,
quitting alcohol or tobacco products, etc. (Johnson suggested we should
consider more than just statistical probability when evaluating
results….)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this a biologically significant effect? Maybe not so much. This is
open to interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics are not objective; they are subjective</strong>.
The depend on the analysis you use, the assumptions you made, and how
you interpreted the results.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you think the result was so
significant?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample size of 12,000 people! Do you think the drug company knew
what they were doing when they gave the drug to 12,000 people? Yeah,
they have statisticians on their payroll, who know what they are
doing…</li>
<li>Drug companies want to use statistics to get their drugs approved.
If you are a drug company statistician, what are you going to do during
your trials? <u>Crank up your sample size</u>. Another way is to give
the highest dose possible without hurting somebody. The highest dose
ensure the best opportunity to measure an effect.
<ul>
<li>An example of this is the birth-control pill: the original pill form
was dosing people multiple factors of ten higher than what was necessary
to prevent pregnancy. It had really bad side-effects for many years!
Drug companies have tricks to make sure they get
statistically-significant results…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important that as scientists we are aware of how statistics
should be used in honest way. Our goal is to help people learn – not to
fool people.</p>
<p>Just because we get a significant p-value, it doesn’t mean that we
have a large biological effect. This is why Johnson (1999) argues that
we <strong>report the estimates of effects</strong> -– slope, difference
– and the <strong>confidence intervals</strong> around those estimates –
measures of uncertainty.</p>
<p><u>We will report effect sizes and uncertainty in this class</u></p>
</div>
<div id="reasons-for-getting-different-p-values" class="section level2">
<h2>Reasons for getting different p-values</h2>
<p><strong>Small p-value</strong> – can be due to a <strong>big effect,
or a big sample size.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Big p-value</strong> – can be due to a <strong>small effect,
or a small sample size.</strong></p>
<p>Just because you do not get a significant p-value does not mean there
is no relationship. This can be due to your sample size being too small!
Wildlife biologists try to do experiments or studies on large animals,
and it’s difficult get sufficient sample sizes to measure significant
effects. It does not mean the effect does not exist! To use the words of
Dushoff, those non-significant results might be better framed as being
‘unclear’ – it’s unclear if there is an effect.</p>
<p><strong>Power analysis</strong> – something you do before an
experiment starts to try to understand the sample size needed to measure
a statistically significant effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Something done before an experiment starts to guide the number of
samples included in the study or experiment. It requires an estimate of
the effect to guess how many samples will be needed to measure the
effect. But we don’t know the effect yet! That’s why we are doing the
study… I think power analysis is <strong>silly</strong>.</li>
<li>Power analysis is often required by IACUC or grant applications.
However, it’s not involved in theses or studies published in
peer-reviewed papers. I won’t teach you how to do this in the
class.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a non-significant p-value, we never really know if it’s
due to sample size or effect size. The solution is to then report the
effect, it’s confidence intervals, and the sample size.</p>
<p>For the heart-attack drug study, assume we didn’t have 12,000
individuals, but rather had 12 in each group. We observed the same 4%
difference, but our P-value was much higher (0.2).</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, we have a small sample size and a small effect
size.</li>
<li>We can calculate confidence intervals: <strong>4% effect plus/minus
12%</strong>.</li>
<li>There is a lot of information in the confidence intervals. The drug
might have as large as a 16% effect. Maybe you would look at that and
say: “16% isn’t big enough, we want a drug that might have 20%. The
results are unclear, but they are clear enough that the effect isn’t
large.”</li>
<li>By looking at the numbers, and not the p-value, we can help make
better decisions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="putting-things-in-perspective" class="section level2">
<h2>Putting things in perspective</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, I said that: science is the search for truth through the
accumulation of facts. Statistics is the method we use to calculate the
estimate of truth using those facts. Keep this in mind. The goal of
every statistical test is to give us an estimate of truth. A p-value
does not provide us the estimate of truth. The estimate of truth is the
slope or a difference between groups and the associated uncertainties
around those effects.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Here is a question you might get asked on your
graduate thesis defense. Which results would you rather have in your
graduate student student?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P = 0.04, <em>n</em> = 20</strong></li>
<li><strong>P = 0.04, <em>n</em> = 120</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first one! There is a bigger effect that was recovered with a
smaller sample size. Both of these effects might be biologically
significant, or not biologically significant. But since the first result
has a larger effect, it is more likely to be a <u>biologically
significant effect</u> in nature.</p>
<p>One problem I see in working with other scientists is that people are
often concerned with trying to understand <em>whether</em> a variable
has an effect. I don’t think this is particularly useful. I want to
understand what <em>is</em> the effect, whether the effect is large or
small, and whether it is biologically significant.</p>
<p>As scientists, let’s assume everything has an effect. This is why we
are doing these studies, because there is something we suspect to be
true and we are thus doing these studies.</p>
<p>In this class, I am going to encourage us as scientists to ask two
questions during our science.</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is that effect?</li>
<li>How clear is our results?</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t need a p-value for either. How big is it?
<strong>Estimate</strong>. How clear is the result? <strong>Confidence
Intervals</strong>.</p>
<p>We will still report the p-value because most journals require them.
But we are moving beyond this (<em>sensu</em> Johnson 1999) will instead
report our EFFECT SIZE and our measure of UNCERTAINTY in that effect
(the 95% confidence intervals) to help infer how clear the results are
(<em>sensu</em> Dushoff et al. 2019).</p>
</div>
<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should have some background familiarity with p-values, t-test,
ANOVA, etc.</li>
<li>Our goals in this class are to use <u>statistics to estimate
truth</u>. We assume there is a relationship, and we want to measure
with it is a big relationship, a small relationship, and/or how
clear.</li>
<li><u>Don’t test for frivolous hypotheses</u> in this class – or ever!
Don’t test whether clear-cuts have small trees than uncut forests. Every
p-value we generate should have an underlying reason to consider.</li>
<li>The purpose of statistics is to <u>test hypotheses</u> that we have.
If you don’t have a hypothesis, don’t run statistics – instead you are
<u>data dredging</u> and wasting your time, but this is <em>not very
good science</em>. Some may be true relationship, but others may be
spurious correlations and that’s why it’s not good science.</li>
<li>Let’s think about what we are doing, why, and what is our goal. It
should be: I want to get an estimate of truth. Will the statistic we are
using give you an estimate of that?</li>
<li>There are many ways to analyze our data… and <u>many may be
incorrect for your needs</u>!! Think carefully and try to use the best
approach that suits our needs.</li>
<li>Always <u>estimate effects</u> and <u>confidence intervals</u>.
Don’t report naked p-values. Let’s look for <u>SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS</u>:
effects that would be measured strong even with small sample sizes.
Sometimes our results will be insignificant and unclear, but if we can
identify substantial effects that are large, then this might direct
further study to get greater samples sizes and measure significant
effects.</li>
<li>The p-value problem is not just a problem for environmental
scientists. American Statistical Association in 2016 came out with a
statement on the use of p-values and made a long to-do list of <u>‘DO
NOTS’</u> for p-values. In 2019, American Statistician special issue:
started with an article “Moving to a World Beyond P-Values” followed by
over 40 separate articles on HOW NOT or HOW TO use p-values. Despite
Johnson (1999) and many others arguing against P-values for decades, the
problem persists.</li>

<h2>Working with data in R:</h2>
<p>To follow along with the R-based lessons and demos, the code is
available on the Schedule on the course website – you should be able to
download an R code file called ‘lecture_2.R’.</p>
<p>I recommend creating a folder on your computer – somewhere
convenient, like your Desktop – that is called
‘<strong>NRES_710</strong>’. Inside that folder, I want you to create an
RStudio ‘project’. Let’s all do that right now.</p>
<p>Open your RStudio project in RStudio, then open the R code file.</p>
<p>Today we will learn about some basic functions and capabilities in R,
and to illustrate that, we will explore some of R’s built-in dataset
(e.g., iris, mtcars, titanic).</p>
<div id="notes-about-working-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Notes about working in R:</h3>
<p>R is an open-source project, and new packages are being added all the
time.</p>
<p>R is incredibly powerful and feature rich. You are NOT expected to
memorize syntax right away, but rather just know that the answer is
always a few clicks away! ‘help’ files in R are extremely useful, as is
information about how to use R that is found in books or on the
internet.</p>
<p>‘Base R’ is the default software built into R that does not including
loading any additional packages. Here is a <a href="base-r.pdf">‘base R’
cheat sheet</a>; this is a great reference for most of the basic tasks
you will need to perform in R.</p>
<p>Learn to use R scripts, and save your scripts frequently! This is the
primary record of what you’ve done and allows you and others to
reproduce your workflows.</p>
<p>If you have a problem, Google it! Someone has likely had the same
problem as you in the past and asked for solutions online. Or, ask
ChatGPT for help on how to solve your coding problem in R. When either
Googling or prompting ChatGPT for help, be mindful that potential
solutions presented to you may not be ideal for your problem.</p>

<p>Note: I recommend always using RStudio projects whenever you are
working on any statistical analysis in R (homework exercises, class

hassle of setting working directories and is a great habit to get into.
By default, the project directory automatically becomes the working
directory for your analysis!</p>
