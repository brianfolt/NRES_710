NOTE: bad reviews- notes on how to do better next time

- Move to MWF schedule with 2 separate lectures and one discussion, ideally with lab
- Spend less time on basic concepts, more time on learning analysis methods*
- R bootcamp mandatory
- Clearer expectations on final project
- Require everyone to use analyses from the class
- Try to make the lectures into slides?
- Don't use made up data? (don't embed to make the made up data)
- Independent rather than group problem solving and homework responses? [need a lab]
- more time on GLM/GLMM
- clearer lectures [move from 2 hours] [basic concepts into multile pages]
- peer reviews were difficult [felt they couldn't do a good job.]  [limit to 15 participants]
- exam questions need to be clearer and better written [revisit]
- Work backwards, start with GLMM skills, then work backwards to basic concepts
- Set lab time. 
- Targeted peer reviews - people select their own project to peer review?
- pair up for homework/labs [lab]
-
