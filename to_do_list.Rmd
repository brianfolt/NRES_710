## To-Do List

Add a 'real' dataset to each exercise. Make it the final 'problem'. 

Add a simulation exercise to lecture 18 to understand how collinearity between fields and plot treatments influences estimation when sample sizes are low. 

Revise readings to make them a little more up-to-date

Maybe trim lectures to make them more efficient (?), maybe remove the post-hoc test lecture (?), maybe add 1-2 more (?)

Add in a lecture on GLMs
