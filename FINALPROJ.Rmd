## Final projects: expectations

The final project is designed to test your ability to understand and apply the tools that you have developed during the semester using R. The project will involve conducting a rigorous data analysis using statistical approaches that we have learned during the semester (or other tools as approved by the instructor). You can choose whichever statistical methods are suitable to your project scope and questions, but they must be methods we covered in class (unless otherwise approved) and appropriate to your data. Please turn in your own work and assignment, but you may use as many resources as you wish (class material, online material, or the insight/experience of other students) to help generate the results and figures. 

The write-up will loosely take the format of a scientific paper to be submitted to a professional journal. However, because of the nature of this course, the most important pieces of the write-up are the **methods** and **results** sections. Nonetheless, I expect at least a few paragraphs introducing the topic and why it's important, and a few paragraphs discussing the implications of the results. Be concise- include only enough text to convey the important information for each section! See below for details.


## Picking a topic and data set

I encourage you to talk with your advisor to see if there is a way you can make the final project directly part of your thesis project or at least relevant to your thesis/dissertation project. You will end up spending quite a bit of time on your final projects, so think about what types of analyses you want/need to get to know better as part of your graduate research. If you don't have a dataset to work with you can choose to work with a public dataset- there are lots of great datasets out there... see [links page](Links.html#Data_links)

#### Project proposal (1 page)  (due Sep 23)

Please provide a 1-page project description. Make sure you include:     

* Project title    
* Name of researcher      
* Brief background (motivation for research question)     
* Research question(s)      
* Primary and ancillary data sources      
* Anticipated analytical approach      


## Draft manuscript (due Nov 25 at 9pm)

Here is a more detailed description of expectations for the manuscript.

**Introduction:** Provide enough description so that the reader understands why the research is important and (if appropriate) what research question(s) and/or hypotheses are being addressed. (approx. 2-3 paragraphs)

**Methods:**      

* Provide just enough details about the data collection to give the reader the context necessary to understand the data.     
* Provide plenty of detail about the analytical approach- enough detail to replicate the analysis. Justify all decisions that were made and (where appropriate) discuss why you did not use alternative approaches.   
* Discuss key assumptions.  

**Results:** Present all relevant results completely yet concisely. Wherever possible, results should be presented via figures and tables. There is a limit of 4 figures and 2 tables, so choose carefully which figures and tables to present. Figures should be *publication quality*, with well-labeled, readable axes. Make sure figure captions have enough information for a reader to interpret the figure without reading the main manuscript!   

**Discussion:** Write at least two paragraphs that put the results in a larger context (returning to the key research questions) and discuss areas of uncertainty. Potential topics are possible violations of assumptions, and future work that your analysis suggests would be profitable.    

**Supplement** Provide all code used to run the analyses presented in the paper as an R script.

## Peer review (December 2)

Your first drafts will be subjected to anonymous peer review. At this time, your assignment will be reviewed by two other students, and the reviews themselves will be graded (each student is expected to submit two peer reviews). The reviews are designed to provide feedback on all aspects of the paper- but for this class the most important aspect of the peer reviews is a critique of the statistical approach being used. For example, are the stats appropriate for the data and the experimental design? Do the results justify the conclusions? Are the assumptions of the analysis and any potential violations of the assumptions discussed in sufficient detail?
