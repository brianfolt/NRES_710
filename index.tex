I have no pre-scheduled office hours for this class- please email me to
set up a meeting. Also note that when I am in my office and my door is
propped open, as will usually be the case when I am not in a meeting or
struggling to meet a deadline, you are welcome to pop in for a chat.
When my office door is closed, I am not available.

\hypertarget{course-meeting-times}{%
\subsubsection{Course Meeting Times}\label{course-meeting-times}}

\textbf{Lecture}: MW 2:30pm to 3:45pm in SEM 347 (Scrugham Engineering
and Mines Building)

\textbf{Course Website}:
\url{http://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-710/}

\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%
\subsubsection{Course Objectives}\label{course-objectives}}

In this course, students will learn basic principles of statistical
inference and will gain experience applying these principles to their
research questions using R. In this course we focus on the concepts and
implementation and we generally leave the nitty-gritty stats questions
to statisticians.

\hypertarget{student-learning-objectives}{%
\subsubsection{Student Learning
Objectives}\label{student-learning-objectives}}

Students will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Communicate, in writing or verbally, the assumptions associated with
  classical statistical models.\\
\item
  Understand and perform statistical tests such as T-test, ANOVAs, and
  linear regression.\\
\item
  Identify and perform appropriate statistical tests on data collected
  during their graduate program\\
\item
  Compare and contrast statistical tools and methods.\\
\item
  Import data, visualize patterns, interpret plots, and perform
  statistical tests using R.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\subsubsection{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

Curious scientific mind, broad research interests, readiness to engage
with data, equations and computer programming. Students are expected to
have a basic understanding of standard statistical concepts and methods,
obtained through other coursework. If this is not the case, they should
be prepared to work harder to develop the necessary prerequisite
knowledge.

\hypertarget{course-materials}{%
\subsubsection{Course materials}\label{course-materials}}

We will use the course website in addition to the WebCampus page set up
for the course. Most course content (lecture materials) can be found on
the website, which will be updated frequently. Additional readings are
available via WebCampus. We will use the Discussion Board feature in
WebCampus as a forum for discussion, Q\&A, and mutual support in
engaging with course materials outside of our regular class meetings.

Readings will be provided as appropriate. Unless otherwise noted, all
readings assigned for a given week should be done before our Wednesday
class meetings. All readings will be posted to WebCampus at least a week
before they are due.

Students will use the open source statistical software R to perform
analyses. \emph{All students should bring laptops to each class}; much
of class time will be devoted to hands-on learning in R.

There are many good R books, but ultimately, most material can be found
for free online. For the beginner in statistics or R, I recommend the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Discovering Statistics using R (Andy Field and Jeremy Miles)
\item
  \href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/}{R for data science} (Garrett Grolemund
  and Hadley Wickham). This book is available for free online.
\item
  Introductory R: A beginner's guide to data visualization, statistical
  analysis, and programming in R (Robert Knell)
\item
  \href{https://r-graphics.org/}{R Graphics Cookbook} (Winston Chang).
  This book is available for free online.
\item
  Qian, Song S. Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R, Second
  Edition, 2nd Edition. Chapman \& Hall, 2017.
\item
  A Primer of Ecological Statistics. (Nicholas Gotelli and Aaron
  Ellison). \emph{A stats book, but not an R book.}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-structure}{%
\subsubsection{Course structure}\label{course-structure}}

Instruction will consist of lessons on general statistical concepts and
specific methods commonly used to address questions in ecology and
environmental science. Stats lessons will include lecture-style
materials, readings, demonstrations, exercises and class discussions.

A large portion of the overall grade (30\%) will be based upon periodic,
relatively brief homework assignments that follow from the topics
covered in class. Most assignments will involve statistical analysis and
interpretation of sample data sets that are provided. There will be a
final project (40\% of your grade) that is designed to test your ability
to understand and apply the tools that you have developed during the
semester using R. The final project will involve conducting a rigorous
data analysis using statistical approaches that we have learned during
the semester (or other tools as approved by the instructor). You can
choose whichever statistical methods are suitable to your project scope
and questions, but they must be methods we covered in class and
appropriate to your data. Please turn in your own work and assignment,
but you may use as many resources as you wish (class material, online
material, or the insight/experience of other students) to generate the
material presented. More specific instructions will come during the
semester.

With roughly 5 weeks left in the semester, first drafts of your final
projects will be due. These first drafts will then be subjected to
anonymous peer review. At this time, the assignment itself will not be
``graded,'' but the assignment will be reviewed by at least two other
students, and the peer reviews will be graded (20\% of the overall
grade). The reviews are designed to provide feedback on the statistical
approach being used and whether the appropriate connections are made
between research question, data, statistical model, and inferences
developed from model outputs. Are the statistics relevant to the data,
and appropriate for the experimental design? The reviews will be due
within two weeks and will be provided to the author for their
consideration and assistance in their final project.

Given the nature of graduate classes, student participation is expected.

\subsubsection{Statement on Academic
Dishonesty}\label{statement-on-academic-dishonesty}}

Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses
constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university.
Plagiarism is using the ideas or words of another person without giving
credit to the original source; this includes copying another student in
class. Always cite the source of your information. This includes copying
or paraphrasing from a book, journal, or unpublished material without
giving credit to the author(s), and submitting a term paper that was
used in another course. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include filing a final grade of ``F''; reducing the
student's final course grade one or two full grade points; awarding a
failing mark on the coursework in question; or requiring the student to
retake or resubmit the coursework. For more details, see the
