Office: Knudsten Resource Center, Room 100A<br> Phone: TBD<br> Email: <a

<p>I have no pre-scheduled office hours for this class; instead, please
email me to set up a meeting. In general, I will be in my office during
working hours from 8:30AM–5PM and can be available to discuss course
material.</p>
</div>

<h3>Course Meeting Times</h3>
<p><strong>Lecture</strong>: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:30–2:45pm, EJCH

</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>In this course, students will learn basic principles of statistical
inference and will gain experience applying these principles to their
research questions using the open-source statistical program <a
href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> with <a
href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">RStudio</a>. We will
focus on concepts and implementation and in general will leave the
nitty-gritty statistics details to other, more focused statistics
classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="student-learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Student Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Communicate, in writing or verbally, the assumptions associated with
classic statistical models.<br />
</li>
<li>Understand and perform statistical tests, such as T-test, ANOVAs,
and linear regression.<br />
</li>
<li>Identify and perform appropriate statistical tests on data collected
during their graduate program.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast statistical tools and methods.<br />
</li>
<li>Import data, visualize patterns, interpret plots, and perform
statistical tests using R.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Curious scientific mind, broad research interests, and readiness to
engage with data, equations, and computer programming. Students are
expected to have a basic understanding of standard statistical concepts
and methods, obtained through other coursework. If this is not the case,
they should be prepared to work hard to develop the necessary
prerequisite knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p>We will use the course website and a WebCampus page set up for the
course. Most course content (lecture materials) can be found on the
course website, which will be updated frequently. Additional readings
are available via WebCampus. We will use the Discussion Board feature in
WebCampus as a forum for discussion, Q&amp;A, and mutual support in
engaging with course materials outside of regular class meetings.</p>
<p>Readings will be provided as appropriate. Unless otherwise noted, all
readings assigned for a given week should be done before our Thursday
class meetings. All readings will be posted to WebCampus at least a week
before they are due.</p>
<p>Students will use the open-source statistical program R to perform
analyses. <strong>All students should bring laptops to each
class</strong>, as much of class time will be devoted to hands-on
learning in R.</p>
<p>There are many good books about R, but ultimately, most material can
be found for free online. For the beginner in statistics or R, I
recommend the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Discovering Statistics using R (Andy Field and Jeremy Miles)</li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for data science (version 2)</a>
(Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund). This
book is available for free online at the website linked here.</li>
<li>Introductory R: a beginner’s guide to data visualization,
statistical analysis, and programming in R (Robert Knell)</li>
<li><a href="https://r-graphics.org/">R Graphics Cookbook</a> (Winston
Chang). This book is available for free online.</li>
<li>Qian, Song S. Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R, Second
Edition, 2nd Edition. Chapman &amp; Hall, 2017.</li>
<li>A Primer of Ecological Statistics. (Nicholas Gotelli and Aaron
Ellison). <em>A stats book, but not an R book.</em></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>Instruction will consist of lessons on general statistical concepts
and specific methods commonly used to address questions in ecology and
environmental science. Stats lessons will include lecture-style
materials, readings, demonstrations, exercises and class
discussions.</p>
<p>A large portion of the overall grade (30%) will be based upon
periodic, relatively brief homework assignments that follow from the
topics covered in class. Most assignments will involve statistical
analysis and interpretation of sample data sets that are provided. There
will be a final project (40% of your grade) that is designed to test
your ability to understand and apply the tools that you have developed
during the semester using R. The final project will involve conducting a
rigorous data analysis using statistical approaches that we have learned
during the semester (or other tools as approved by the instructor). You
can choose whichever statistical methods are suitable to your project
scope and questions, but they must be methods we covered in class and
appropriate to your data. Please turn in your own work and assignment,
but you may use as many resources as you wish (class material, online
material, or the insight/experience of other students) to generate the
material presented. More specific instructions will come during the
semester.</p>
<p>With roughly 5 weeks left in the semester, first drafts of your final
projects will be due. These first drafts will then be subjected to
anonymous peer review. At this time, the assignment itself will not be
“graded,” but the assignment will be reviewed by at least two other
students, and the peer reviews will be graded (20% of the overall
grade). The reviews are designed to provide feedback on the statistical
approach being used and whether the appropriate connections are made
between research question, data, statistical model, and inferences
developed from model outputs. Are the statistics relevant to the data,
and appropriate for the experimental design? The reviews will be due
within two weeks and will be provided to the author for their
consideration and assistance in their final project.</p>
<p>Given the nature of graduate classes, student participation is
expected.</p>

<div id="statement-on-academic-dishonesty" class="section level3">
<h3>Statement on Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>Cheating, plagiarism, or otherwise obtaining grades under false
pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this
university. Plagiarism is using the ideas or words of another person
without giving credit to the original source; this includes copying
another student in class. Always cite the source of your information.
This includes copying or paraphrasing from a book, journal, or
unpublished material without giving credit to the author(s), and
submitting a term paper that was used in another course. Academic
dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include filing a
final grade of “F”; reducing the student’s final course grade one or two
full grade points; awarding a failing mark on the coursework in
question; or requiring the student to retake or resubmit the coursework.
