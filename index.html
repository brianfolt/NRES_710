<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>Statistics are fundamental to the generation of scientific knowledge. In this course, students will learn basic principles of statistical inference and will gain experience applying these principles to questions in ecology and environmental science using the R environment for statistical computing. In this course we focus on the concepts and implementation and we generally leave the nitty-gritty stats questions to statisticians.</p>
</div>
<div id="student-learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Student Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Communicate, in writing or verbally, the assumptions associated with classical statistical models.<br />
</li>
<li>Understand and perform statistical tests such as T-test, ANOVAs, and linear regression.<br />
</li>
<li>Identify and perform appropriate statistical tests on data collected during their graduate program<br />
</li>
<li>Compare and contrast statistical tools and methods.<br />
</li>
<li>Import data, visualize patterns, interpret plots, and perform statistical tests using R.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Curious scientific mind, broad research interests, readiness to engage with equations and computer programming. Students are expected to already have a basic understanding of standard statistical concepts and methods, obtained through other coursework. If this is not the case, they should be prepared to work harder to develop the necessary prerequisite knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="required-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Required materials</h3>
<p>Readings and handouts will be provided as appropriate. Unless otherwise noted, all readings assigned for a given week should be done before our Wednesday class meetings. All readings will be posted to WebCampus at least a week before they are due.</p>
<p>Students will use the open source statistical software R to perform analyses. <em>All students should bring laptops to each class</em>; much of class time will be devoted to hands-on learning in R.</p>
<p>There are many good R books, but ultimately, most material can be found for free online. For the beginner in statistics or R, I recommend the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Discovering Statistics using R (Andy Field and Jeremy Miles)</li>
<li>Introductory R: A beginner’s guide to data visualization, statistical analysis, and programming in R (Robert Knell)</li>
<li>R Graphics Cookbook (Winston Chang). This book is available for free as a PDF online.</li>
<li>Qian, Song S. Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R, Second Edition, 2nd Edition. Chapman &amp; Hall, 2017.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Course structure</h3>
<p>Instruction will consist of lessons on general statistical concepts and specific methods commonly used to address questions in ecology and environmental science. Stats lessons will include lecture-style materials, readings, demonstrations, exercises and class discussions. In general, our Monday class meetings will consist of instructor-led lectures and R demos, and the Wednesday class meetings will consist of student-led discussions.</p>
<p>There will be one midterm exam and one final project. The midterm exam will be based on stats lessons and will include both a traditional in-class exam and a take-home exam in which you will use R to make inference from provided datasets.</p>
<p>Homework assignments will occur throughout the semester. They are designed to provide you and me with progress assessments. Therefore, the frequency and subjects of the assignments will depend on the pace of progress during the semester.</p>
<p>The final project is designed to test your ability to understand and apply the tools that you have developed during the semester using R. The project will involve conducting a rigorous data analysis using statistical approaches that we have learned during the semester (or other tools as approved by the instructor). You can choose whichever statistical methods are suitable to your project scope and questions, but they must be methods we covered in class and appropriate to your data. Please turn in your own work and assignment, but you may use as many resources as you wish (class material, online material, or the insight/experience of other students) to generate the material presented. More specific instructions will come during the semester.</p>
<p>With roughly a month left in the semester, first drafts of your final projects will be due. These first drafts will then be subjected to anonymous peer review. At this time, the assignment itself will not be “graded,” but the assignment will be reviewed by at least two other students, and the reviews will be graded. The reviews are designed to provide feedback on the statistical approach being used. For example, are the stats relevant to the data? Will the stats appropriate to the experimental design? The reviews will be due in one week and will be provided to the author for their consideration and assistance in their final project.</p>
<p>Given the nature of graduate classes, student participation is expected.</p>
<p>Grades will be assigned as follows (percentage is calculated as fraction of total semester score): Midterm exam (and optional final): 20% Final project (including peer review): 40% Homework/exercises: 20% Overall class participation: 20%</p>

<h3>Make-up policy and late work:</h3>
<p>If you miss a class meeting or lab period, it is your responsibility to talk to one of your classmates about what you missed. If you miss a lab meeting, you are still responsible for completing the lab activities and write-up on your own time. You do not need to let me know in advance that you are going to miss class or lab.</p>

<div id="statement-on-academic-dishonesty" class="section level3">
<h3>Statement on Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university. Plagiarism is using the ideas or words of another person without giving credit to the original source; this includes copying another student in class. Always cite the source of your information. This includes copying or paraphrasing from a book, journal, or unpublished material without giving credit to the author(s), and submitting a term paper that was used in another course. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include filing a final grade of “F”; reducing the student’s final course grade one or two full grade points; awarding a failing mark on the coursework in question; or requiring the student to retake or resubmit the coursework.

<p>In response to COVID-19, and in alignment with State of Nevada Governor Executive Orders, Roadmap to Recovery for Nevada plans, Nevada System of Higher Education directives, the University of Nevada President directives, and local, state, and national health official guidelines face coverings are required at all times while on campus, except when alone in a private office. This includes the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space, or any type of in-person instructional activity, and public spaces.</p>
<p>A “face covering” is defined as a “covering that fully covers a person’s nose and mouth, including without limitation, cloth face mask, surgical mask, towels, scarves, and bandanas” (State of Nevada Emergency Directive 024).</p>
<p>Students that cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition or disability, or who are unable to remove a mask without assistance may seek an accommodation through the Disability Resource Center.</p>

<h3>Statement on COVID-19 Social Distancing</h3>
<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing. Students shall observe current social distancing guidelines where possible in accordance with the Phase we are in while in the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space (hereafter referred to as instructional space) setting and in public spaces. Students should avoid congregating around instructional space entrances before or after class sessions. If the instructional space has designated entrance and exit doors students are required to use them. Students should exit the instructional space immediately after the end of instruction to help ensure social distancing and allow for the persons attending the next scheduled class session to enter.</p>
