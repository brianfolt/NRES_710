</div>
<div id="class-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Class structure</h2>
<p>The most important feature of this class is the <a
href="https://brianfolt.github.io/NRES_710/">course website</a>! <a
href="https://brianfolt.github.io/NRES_710/"
class="uri">https://brianfolt.github.io/NRES_710/</a></p>
<p>We will discuss the course organization and expectations. Please see
<a href="syllabus.docx">course syllabus</a> and <a
href="schedule.pdf">schedule</a> documents, provided separately.</p>
<p><strong>Office hours:</strong> no office hours, best thing to do is
send me an email and find a time to meet; I am happy to meet with you;
my office is in KRC 100, enter from the north side of the building.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Students are expected to have a basic
understanding of standard statistical concepts and methods, obtained
through other coursework. They should be familiar with what a p-value
is, an ANOVA, a t-test, these sorts of basic things. But, we are going
to cover all of these topics in class – with a practical emphasis.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> The typical schedule for the class will be
a <strong>lecture</strong> on Tuesdays and either another lecture or an
laboratory <strong>Exercise</strong> on Thursdays. Some days there will
be required readings to be read prior to class, so keep an eye on the
schedule for those.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> This is a graduate student class and
attendance is not mandatory; you are all adults and make your own
decisions. Life happens &amp; you will be busy with field work, other
obligations, conferences, whatever. It’s okay: if you can’t make class,
no reason to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises:</strong> The largest part of your grade in the
class will be from <strong>Exercises</strong> (60%). These will be every
two weeks ago so during the semester, and my goal is have eight
different exercises. We will use class time to work on the Exercises;
you can work on them individually or in small groups with 2-3 people. I
encourage you to work on these with your peers, because a great way to
learn material is by communicating it to someone else. However, the goal
of the class is to learn how to analyze data and learn those practical
skills. So I encourage you to be mindful and make sure that you are
learning the material yourselves.</p>
<p>On class days with Exercises, we will work on the material in class.
I will be present and available for questions. I will be available to
help answer questions and provide guidance on how to complete the
Exercises! My hope is that you all will be able to finish the Exercises
during classtime, and then I will briefly review your work and give you
credit for completing the assignment. However, if you are unable to
attend the class session or unable to finish the Exercise during class,
you will have six days to complete it and submit it through
WebCampus.</p>
<p>However, if at all possible, please attend <strong>Exercise</strong>
sessions. My goal for these sessions is that we will all work through
the Exercises at the same time. My hope is that you will all be able to
finish these important learning assignments during the class session,
and then I will review your work and mark you down in the gradebook as
having completed the assignment properly. If you can’t make the Exercise
class for some reason, that’s okay, you can submit the assignment
through WebCampus.</p>
<p>Lab assignments will be up in advanced of the lab. You are welcome to
start working on them in advanced, show up to class, get your work
checked off, and leave.</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes:</strong> There will be 6-7 quizzes throughout the
semester (20%). They will be given through WebCampus and they will
become available the day after the material is presented. Sometimes
there will be quick turnaround times on the quizzes and you will only
have ~36 hours to finish them. So be mindful of quiz dates and getting
them done before they are due.</p>
<p><strong>Participation:</strong> Students will be graded on
<strong>Participation</strong> (20%). As this is a graduate-level class,
engagement and participation during class, discussions, exercise labs,
and other course-related opportunities is expected and students will be
given a grade on their participation.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> An extra-credit opportunity is
available to students by participating in ‘<a
href="https://guides.library.unr.edu/StatsChats">StatsChats</a>’.
StatsChats is an informal weekly gathering to discuss any quantitative
questions you may have related to your research (statistics,
experimental design, model simulation, analysis, debugging R code,
etc.).</p>
<p>Faculty from various departments – Paul Hurtado (math/stats dept),
Ken Nussear (geography), Perry Williams (NRES), Kevin Shoemaker (NRES)
and others – have hosted informal sessions for grad students in EECB,
NRES, Geography etc (and faculty) to discuss data analysis questions.
This can be a good opportunity to ask questions about statistics, find
out more about what types of data and questions your peers are working
with, and help others (thereby reinforcing concepts for yourself!). Keep
an eye on that website linked above and if the group identifies a
regular meeting time, I will relay that information to you all in
class.</p>
<p>This is open to any students and faculty that want to improve their
their quantitative skills and/or share their knowledge and experience.
StatsChats will be weekly on Tuesdays (starting September 3) from 12-1PM
in the Lilli Brant reading room in the DeLaMare Science and Engineering
Library (third floor). Students will gain +10% credit to their overall
class grade <strong>if they attend four (4) out of the ten total
StatsChats sessions during the semester</strong>.</p>

materials, including lecture and exercise materials, readings, and other
useful information.</p>

<div id="general-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>General overview</h2>
<p>NRES 710 is designed to be an introductory, graduate-level statistics
class. “Introductory” because you are not assumed to have much in the
way of prior statistical knowledge (although an undergrad course under
your belt will be helpful) or prior experience in R programming
(although some prior exposure will make the learning curve less steep).
“Graduate-level” because once we get rolling, it’ll be full steam ahead!
However, another dimension of a graduate-level course is an emphasis on
collaborative knowledge development through group discussion and
collective learning, and NRES 710 will provide opportunities for
this.</p>
<p>This course provides an introduction to both statistics and computer
programming in R. With a solid grounding in basic rules of probability
and statistics, and armed with some basic computer programming abilities
(and some human creativity and ingenuity), you can go extremely far in
making sense of data and communicating that understanding with
others!</p>
<p>The purpose of this class is two-fold. <strong>First</strong>, I want
to teach you many of the <strong>common statistical tests</strong> that
you will see in various research journals in your field! My hope is that
by avoiding diving into the weeds on theory, we can explore many
different statistical tests in simple, easy to understand, and practical
ways. However, I will try to teach you some high-level theory about
these tests. I want you to understand enough theory to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>why</em> you are using a statistical tests?</li>
<li>what are the <em>assumptions</em> that the test makes?</li>
<li>what do the results <em>mean</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>And the <strong>second</strong> goal of the class is to <strong>learn
how to do these tests in the statistical program R</strong>. Why using
R…? It’s awesome, flexible, and <strong>free</strong>. Many other
schools have their favored softwares for statistics, but most people in
ecology and environmental sciences use R. It is free, open source, and
growing at an exponential rate in terms of what you can do with it.
Packages are being developed daily to produce additional statistical
capacity for it. It’s great.</p>
<p>‘Base R’ is the default software built into R that does not including
loading any additional packages. Here is a <a href="base-r.pdf">‘base R’
cheat sheet</a>; this is a great reference for most of the basic tasks
you will need to perform in R.</p>
<p>Learn to use R scripts, and save your scripts frequently! This is the
primary record of what you’ve done and allows you and others to
reproduce your workflows.</p>
<p>How many of you have used R before?</p>
<p>How many of you have used other statistical softwares: SAS, JMP,
SPSS, Julia…?</p>
<p><strong>No text book.</strong> We will follow material that I am
producing and that will be available on the course website and other
free resources from the internet. Part of the reason why we have a
course website is to provide ~physical documentation of everything we
are learning: lectures, code, exercises, resources, etc. So the course
website will be the primary resource for learning the material in the
class. However, there are additional links on the Syllabus and the the
‘Links’ page on the course website that provide access to other free,
openly available information.</p>

<div id="course-schedule" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Schedule</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the course schedule.</p>
<p>Links everywhere! I will update these weekly to add lecture material
after it is presented in class.</p>
<p>Readings! Note the dates associated with readings and be sure to read
the papers before the class date indicated.</p>
<p>Code! I hope to make all of the code for lectures available to you
before class. My intention with that would be that as I am demonstrating
code on the computer, that you could follow along in R on your computer
and take notes in your code. I still need to figure out a way to do
provide this, so hang tight.</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Truth</strong>. In this class, we
will generally not use data of unknown sources. One thing that I found
challenging about statistics classes is they often give you data, you
run an analysis, and afterword you ask yourself: ‘Did I do this right?’
‘Is this the right answer?’ How do we know?</p>
<p>In this class, we will <strong>generate all of the datasets that we
analyze</strong>. We will tell R what ‘truth’ is, and then we will
simulate data. Then, when we learn how to use the statistical tests, we
will know whether they are working properly, because they should
estimate values that we know to be ‘truth’.</p>
<p>The datasets will be fixed-number CSV files. But these will be
generated by R-code in the lectures or laboratories. I will provide the
R-code that is used to simulate truth, so you can examine it to see what
the values are for truth and learn how data simulation works.</p>

<div id="note" class="section level2">
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>This is my first time teaching this class. Given this is my first
time teaching this specific material in this format, I welcome frequent
and honest feedback on course topics to understand whether course topics
are appropriate and/or useful, if links are broken, if I forgot to set
an assignment date, etc. So, any feedback is welcomed – thank you!</p>
</div>
<div id="questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions??</h2>
<p>Any questions about anything related to how the class will work?</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-science" class="section level2">
<h2>What is science?</h2>
<p><strong>Science is the search for <em>truth</em> through the
accumulation of <em>facts</em>. It is a method of answering
questions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The terms <em>facts</em> and <em>truth</em> are often used
synonymously.</li>
<li><strong>Truth</strong> is the way things really are, what’s really
happening, what we want to know about how the world works.
<ul>
<li>The problem is that we can never really know truth. We can seek to
understand it and try to know it, but we can never know truth.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Truth exists, and we want to know it, but we can never really know it
because of two problems:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Sampling error</strong> – there are always errors in
measurements.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How tall is Dr. Brian Folt? If everyone in the class tried to
measure me to the mm, how many different measurements would we get? 25!
<ul>
<li>Error will happen because I slouch, people have to stand on a chair,
shaky hands, etc., etc.</li>
<li>This is all sampling error!</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> How can we decrease sampling error? Standardize
procedure, measurers, tools…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can decrease error by standardizing measurers and measurement
methods. And then we can take an <strong>average</strong> to get a
pretty good <strong>estimate</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Process error</strong> – <strong>underlying features that
contribute to variation in whatever is being measured</strong>. This is
harder to understand, and we might benefit from using a slightly more
complicated example.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> On the UNR campus, who is taller:
<strong>Students</strong> or <strong>Faculty</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking around campus, we might make an observation that Students
are taller than Faculty. They are young, growing, and have great
posture. Faculty are old, aren’t growing, have bad posture (me!)</li>
<li>Students are maybe a little taller on average…? But there is
overlap. Not all students are the same size, and not all faculty are the
same size. There is variation in each of these groups that causes
overlap in size. This overlap makes it hard to know exactly how much
taller students are than faculty. What causes this overlap?</li>
<li><strong>Process error</strong>. Process error is underlying
processes that contribute to the outcome on an individual by individual
basis. What things might cause height to vary among students and
faculty?
<ul>
<li>Diet</li>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Behavior</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process error</strong> – <strong>underlying features that
contribute to variation in whatever is being measured</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If every faculty member was the same height and every student was
the same height, it would be really easy to measure the difference. But
they aren’t! There are other processes that contribute to height outside
of whether someone is a student or faculty member, which makes it
difficult to come up with a good estimate of height.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is due to process error. Process error is often thought of as
<strong>‘Noise’</strong> in the system. Process error can be due to
systematic systematic processes that we might be able to measure, or
random variation.</p>
<p>Statisticians often chalk up process error as ‘random noise’. But
this is noise is often driven by underlying processes! We can create
predictive models to understand whether coins will land as heads or
tails, to predict what clothes we will wear in the morning (optimizing
style, comfort, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why does process error make it difficult for us
to understand truth? For example, would we test for height differences
between Students and Faculty? What would our experiment be?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample!! We might ask 100 students and 100 faculty how tall they
are, and it might give us an estimate of an effect. Why might this not
be accurate?
<ul>
<li>People lie?</li>
<li>Small sample size? OR, sample size is not
<em>representative</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Our sample may not be representative, due to random chance and
process error. If by some random chance, we don’t get any samples from
the basketball team, then we estimate for student height might be LOW.
Or, if we only sample the gymnastics team, also low.</li>
<li>With small sample sizes, those underlying process errors can
influence our ability to measure real effects.</li>
<li>But, if our sample is representative, then we should be able to get
pretty close to ‘truth’ – although there will always be some error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How could we ensure TRUTH?</p>
<p>If we sample the entire population, we can approximate truth! But
it’s often impractical to get the whole population. We often don’t have
access to the entire population, and we must resort to taking
samples.</p>
<p>So we have talked about <strong>truth</strong>, what about
<strong>facts</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Facts – estimates of truth</strong> from our sample</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Going back to our original definition, science is the search for
truth through the accumulation of facts. We want to understand how the
world works – and we do that by collecting data and accumulating facts.
Data are facts.</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements. Facts might be accurate, inaccurate; they might be
reliable and repeatable, or they might not be reliable and
repeatable.</p></li>
<li><p>We go out and we collect data, and these data are facts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How does ‘statistics’ come into this? <strong>Statistics is the
method (math) by which we use facts (data) to estimate
truth.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We collect data (facts) and use statistics to calculate an average
(a statistic), which is an estimate of truth, based on facts.</li>
<li>You can’t do science without statistics!</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use statistics as a process to make inference about a property
of a <em>population</em> (a parameter) from a representative
<em>sample</em>. In the figure below, the vertical line separates the
stuff we can observe and measure directly (<em>facts</em>; right side)
and the stuff we can’t observe but want to make inference about
(<em>truth</em>; left side).</p>
<p><img src="statistics2.png" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>Do you see the ‘p-value’ anywhere in here?</p>
<ul>
<li>P-values are not statistics. They are not estimates of truth.</li>
<li>P-values have their value and their place in this field. But, it’s
my opinion and others that most statistic classes emphasize P-values way
too much, in my opinion. That’s why we are going to read papers about on
this topic before class on Thursday.</li>
</ul>
<p>In we are going to learn how to use statistics to estimate truth. To
do this, I am going to make my own data! That way we can know whether
the statistical methods we are using are estimating truth properly! We
will learn about what a p-value is and how it is used, but try to
de-emphasize p-values and place more emphasis on measure effects and
uncertainty around those effects. I also mentioned that truth is
impossible to know, so how can we know if we are doing a good job of
estimating it? We will SIMULATE DATA to know truth, so that we can then
fit statistical analyses and ensure that we are correctly estimating
truth.</p>
