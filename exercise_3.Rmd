## Exercise 3 -- Regression Assumptions

For each of the following datasets, import the data into R and analyze the data using regression. Then, provide the following information in a Microsoft Word document:

- Using the statement we discussed in class, describe the relationship between X and Y, and be sure to include the p-value. Describe the relationship even if it isn't 'significant' (you fail to reject the null), but be sure to state that the relationship isn't significant, if that's the case.

- What assumption(s) of regression is violated with this dataset? Cut and paste the graph that visually informed you that an assumption was violated. Note: only one assumption has truly been violated; if more than one assumption appears to be violated, choose the one that appears to be the strongest violation.

Compile all of your results in a Word document. Load this into the WebCampus assignment portal and submit it by the due date indicated in the course schedule.

## Problems 

**[Dataset 1](exercise_3_dataset1.csv)** -- the relationship between prey density (X; prey/ha) and predation rate (Y; prey killed per predator per day).

**[Dataset 2](exercise_3_dataset2.csv)** -- the relationship between tree basal area (Y; m2) and stand age (X; years).

**[Dataset 3](exercise_3_dataset3.csv)** -- the relationship between prey density (X; prey/ha) and black bear litter size (Y; pups); Note: litter size is not continuous, but that's not the assumption that has been violated.

**[Dataset 4](exercise_3_dataset4.csv)** -- the relationship between road density (X; roads/km2) and probability of habitat use by sage grouse (Y; %).

**[Dataset 5](exercise_3_dataset5.csv)** -- the relationship between native deer (X; deer/ha) and number of domestic livestock killed by wolves (Y; livestock/km2).

- For this problem, describe the relationship between X and Y using the standard statements, but also use prediction to report what the expected number of livestock killed by tigers is at 20.0 deer/ha with prediction intervals. Finally, generate a graph of the y predictions and the prediction intervals, like we saw in class.

## Truth

If you would like to know the values used to create these datasets (i.e., 'truth'), examine the code below:

### Exercise 3: code to simulate datasets 

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## Dataset 1
# Simulate X-variable
n <- 150
x <- runif(n, 0, 10)

# Simulate error
error <- rep(NA, n)
for (i in 1:n){
  error[i] <- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 0.5 * x[i])
}

# Calculate Y-variable
y <- abs(2 + 0.5 * x + error) # abs() gets rid of negative numbers drawn by chance

# Create dataframe
datum <- data.frame(PreyDens = x, PredRate = y)

# Save the CSV file
write.csv(datum, "exercise_3_dataset1.csv")


## Dataset 2
# Simulate x-variable
n <- 70
x <- seq(0, n, by = 1)

# Simulate error
error <- rep(NA, n + 1)
error[1] <- 0
for (i in 2:(n + 1)){
  error[i] <- rnorm(1, mean = error[i-1], 2)
}

# Calculate y
y <- 2 + 2 * x + error

# Create dataframe
datum <- data.frame(Age = x, BasalArea = y)

# Save the CSV file
write.csv(datum, "exercise_3_dataset2.csv")


## Dataset 3
# Simulate x-variable
n <- 100
x <- runif(n, 0, 10)

# Error
error <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, 1)

# Y variable
y <- round(1 + 0.5 * x + error^2, 0)
  
# Dataframe
datum <- data.frame(PreyDensity = x, LitterSize = y)

# Save the CSV file
write.csv(datum, "exercise_3_dataset3.csv")


## Dataset 4
# Simulate x-variable
n <- 100
x <- runif(n, 0, 10)

# Error
error <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, 0.05)

# Y variable
y <- 0.2 + 0.1 * x - 0.01 * x^2 + error

# Dataframe
datum <- data.frame(RoadDensity = x, ProbUse = y)

# Save the CSV file
write.csv(datum, "exercise_3_dataset4.csv")


## Dataset 5
# Simulate x-variable
n <- 50

# X variable
x <- runif(n, 0, 5)

# error
error <- rnorm(n, 0, 2)

# Y variable
y <- abs(8 - 1*x + error)

# Create dataframe
datum <- data.frame(DeerDensity = x, CowsKilled = y)

# Save the CSV file
write.csv(datum, "exercise_3_dataset5.csv")
```
